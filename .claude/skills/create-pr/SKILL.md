## Steps

1. **Check current state**:
   ```bash
   git status
   git diff --stat
   git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline
   ```

2. **Analyze changes** to determine:
   - Type: What kind of change is this? (feat, fix, refactor, etc.)
   - Scope: Which area/feature is affected? (auth, courses, api, etc.)
   - Summary: What does the change do? (imperative, capitalized)

3. **Push branch if needed**:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin HEAD
   ```

4. **Create PR** using gh CLI with the template from `.github/pull_request_template.md`:
   ```bash
   gh pr create --draft --title "<type>(<scope>): <summary>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
